    "# Welcome to In-browser markdown editor App! 🍃\n\nThis is an in-browser markdown editor app, which you can use to write markdown and preview it in the browser, download it, copy it, and save it to a file. This project is built with `typescript`, `react` and `tailwind CSS`.  \n\n## Table of contents\n\n- [Overview](#overview)\n  - [The challenge](#the-challenge)\n  - [Screenshot](#screenshot)\n  - [Links](#links)\n- [Built with](#built-with)\n  - [What I learned](#what-i-learned)\n - [Author](#author)\n\n## Overview\n\n### The challenge\n\nUsers should be able to:\n\n- Create, Read, Update, and Delete markdown documents\n- Download markdown documents as a `.md` file\n- Name, rename and save documents to be accessed as needed (using local storage).\n- Copy markdown document to the clipboard\n- Edit the markdown of a document and see the formatted preview of the content\n- Toggle between full-page and preview mode\n- Toggle between dark and light mode\n- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size\n- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page\n\n### Screenshot\n\n![screenshot](https://github.com/remyboire/markdowneditor/blob/main/screenshot.jpg?raw=true)\n\n### Links\n\n- Live Project [In-browser markdown editor App](https://mouhametnd-markdown-editor.netlify.app/)\n- My Linkedin [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mouhametndiaye/)\n## My process\n\n### Built with\n\n- React\n - Typescript\n - Redux - Toolkit\n - Tailwind CSS\n - LocalStorage (to save documents and preferences to be accessed later)\n - Mobile-first workflow\n\n\n### What I learned\n\nThis project was a good one to practice my skills in `React`, `Typescript`, `Tailwind CSS` and `Redux`.

    "content": "# Welcome to Markdown\n\nMarkdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents.\n\n## How to use this?\n\n1. Write markdown in the markdown editor window\n2. See the rendered markdown in the preview window\n\n### Features\n\n- Create headings, paragraphs, links, blockquotes, inline-code, code blocks, and lists\n- Name and save the document to access again later\n- Choose between Light or Dark mode depending on your preference\n\n> This is an example of a blockquote. If you would like to learn more about markdown syntax, you can visit this [markdown cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).\n\n#### Headings\n\nTo create a heading, add the hash sign (#) before the heading. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level. You'll see in this guide that we've used all six heading levels (not necessarily in the correct way you should use headings!) to illustrate how they should look.\n\n##### Lists\n\nYou can see examples of ordered and unordered lists above.\n\n###### Code Blocks\n\nThis markdown editor allows for inline-code snippets, like this: `<p>I'm inline</p>`. It also allows for larger code blocks like this:\n\n```\n<main>\n  <h1>This is a larger code block</h1>\n</main>\n```"
