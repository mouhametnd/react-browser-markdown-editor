## My process

### Built with

- React
- Typescript
- Redux - Toolkit
- Tailwind CSS
- LocalStorage (to save documents and preferences to be accessed later)
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This project was a good one to practice my skills in `React`, `Typescript`, `Tailwind CSS` and `Redux`. I learned how to implement `typescript` in a `React` project, how to use better `redux` and `redux-toolkit` to manage the state of the application, and how to use `tailwind CSS` to style the app.
